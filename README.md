# Responsive-Design

This project demonstrates how to create a responsive navigation bar with a menu for smaller screens and a sidebar with a close button for larger screens. The navigation bar is built using HTML, styled with CSS using Flexbox for alignment, and enhanced with JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

## Features:

Responsive design: Adjusts layout based on screen size.
Menu: For smaller screens, collapses navigation into a menu.
Sidebar: For larger screens, displays navigation as a sidebar.
Close button: Allows users to close the sidebar on larger screens.
Basic DOM manipulation: Utilizes JavaScript for toggling sidebar visibility
